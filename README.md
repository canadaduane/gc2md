# GC2MD: Google Contacts to Markdown


This is a script for converting a csv export of google contacts to individual markdown files all in one directory.
This was intended for use with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but edit it to your liking and take out the header content if your markdown editor doesn't support meta content.


**Notice**

This isn't anything fancy, just a script I used to help me get set up and won't be using it again. For someone that wanted to sync their contacts to markdown without editing the files that are uploaded, this idea could be used, but I would recommend expanding on/cleaning up the way subjects are mapped to markdown. Ie phone number types should be listed out with the number isntead of new lines, and addresses generally should be better handled.


## Usage

- Get google contacts csv export [here](https://contacts.google.com/)
- Fill in the directory paths at the top of the script
- run `python3 gc2md.py`
