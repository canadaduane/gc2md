# GC2MD: Google Contacts to Markdown

This is a script for converting a csv export of google contacts to individual markdown files all in one directory.
This was intended for use with (Obsidian)[https://obsidian.md/], but edit it to your liking and take out the headercontent if your markdown editor doesn't support meta content.

## Usage

- Get google contacts csv export (here)[https://contacts.google.com/]
- Fill in the directory paths at the top of the script
